Wanted to do some coding to procrastinate and I have been working on an astrophysics course for the summer. 
I'd always forget the steps to convert units in calculations, so I thought I'd make it a billion times easier and just have my code do it for me.
Online converters are also tedious to setup, so I wanted something that would be easy and quick to use.

Made this in half a day, so it's not the best but for what it's worth. At least I procrastinated.
